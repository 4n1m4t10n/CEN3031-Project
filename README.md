# Project name: Melanoma Classification App (TBD)

# Project description:

Create a web application for melanoma classification model which allows users to upload image and relevant healthcare information. The project will be based on creating a user interface where they can upload 
Skin lesion image
Additional personal/contact information
The goal is to create an application that will allow users to upload an image and allow them to run it through a model that allows them to assess their risk. The main goal is to create an application and database that stores both image and text data, with stretch goals of directly connecting it to the melanoma classification model.

# User Stories

## Currently in development

As an app user, I would like to be able to create an account on the application such that I am able to have a place to upload images safely.

As an app user, I would like to be able to upload images that may be stored and retrieved later to track health progression.

As a researcher, I would like the user to be able to store relevant information regarding health or demographic data that may be useful for tracking of health status.

As an app user, I would like to be able to store several images at a time so that I don't waste time uploading them one at a time.

## Future stories to implement

As an app user, I would like to be able to select an image to be submitted so that it may be processed through the model.

As an app user, I would like to have the option for the image to be saved and sent for further training of the classification model, so that performance may be improved.

As a researcher, I would like for the user to have the option to store the image and allow its usage for further model training.

As an app user, I would like the option to change my password so that I can access my account in the event I forget my log in.

As an app user, I would like the option to sort through my saved images based on the date I uploaded them.

As an app user, I would like to be able to delete images that I have stored so that I can get rid past images.
