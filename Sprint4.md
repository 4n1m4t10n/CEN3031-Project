# Work completed in Sprint 4

In the backend, we did some code clean up and separated our functions into two files endpoint.go and helpers.go. The endpoint.go holds the functions that have endpoints such as GET, POST, PUT and helpers.go holds the helper functions that are used within the endpoint functions. We also fixed up some existing code to help facilitate image display on the front end through use of tokens and authentication (see frontend for more info). Finally, in Sprint 4 we attempted to set up an online database using Microsoft Azure SQL and editted our code in order to support this new online database.
