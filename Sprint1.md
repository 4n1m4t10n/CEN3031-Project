# Sprint 1 - Group 38

# User Stories Planned For The Future
As a researcher, I would like for the user to have the option to store the image and allow its usage for further model training.

As an app user, I would like the option to change my password so that I can access my account in the event I forget my log in.

As an app user, I would like the option to sort through my saved images based on the date I uploaded them.

As an app user, I would like to be able to delete images that I have stored so that I can get rid past images.

As an app user, I would like to be able to create an account on the application such that I am able to have a place to upload images safely.


# User Stories Planned For Sprint 1
As an app user, I would like to have the option for the image to be saved and sent for further training of the classification model, so that performance may be improved.

As an app user, I would like to be able to select an image to be submitted so that it may be processed through the model.

As an app user, I would like to receive useful information based on the specifics provided by my submitted data.

As an app user, I would like to be able to upload images that may be stored and retrieved later to track health progression.

As a researcher, I would like the user to be able to store relevant information regarding health or demographic data that may be useful for tracking of health status.

As an app user, I would like to be able to store several images at a time so that I don't waste time uploading them one at a time.

As an app user, I would like to count with an easy to use interface that provides me with all the options I need to undergo the process easily.

different parameters we have stored per user including name, email, password, gender, and age. While we may add ethnicity to this list, these are the pieces of info we have for our users. Along with this, we have a log in page created on the front-end as the start of an easy to use interface for the customer.

# Unsuccessful Stories
The failures we had for the back-end in the early stages of getting functionality include some bugs in the user struct of the code. We are also unable to submit multiple images at once as we would need to create individual directories for each account on the application that store all the images. This is something we will work on in the future Sprints, as well as deleting images and sorting them by date added. In the front-end,
